# The Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) model
These pages aim to describe the SaDS model and explain functionally how to run the model and work with its outputs.

## Summary
SaDS models supraglacial meltwater flow in order to calculate the rate of flow into moulins. It does this by following the structure of GlaDS [(Werder et al., 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20146). Water flows across the glacier surface in a distributed sheet and through supraglacial rivers. The entire drainage system evolves throughout the melt season depending on the balance between surface melt and heat dissipation in the channels.

## This documentation
For more details about the mathematical basis of the model, see the paper (TBD). The rest of this documentation focuses on the practical aspects of setting up and running the model, and analyzing its outputs. See the configuration page for information on how to set up and run the model, and the analysis page for information on analyzing the outputs. Follow along with the example included with the model code to get familiar with the model.
